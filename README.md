# February-24th-2017-IoT-Hardware-Workshop-Results
This repository features the code used for the FIU UPE IoT Hardware Workshop (on February 24th, 2017) written on the Arduino IDE.

The code just makes the LED on the Adafruit Feather mO (the development board used for this workshop) blink in 1 second intervals.
